# TextDecryptor-Encryptor_Learning

I created this program by follwing a [youtube tutorial for python](https://youtu.be/ix9cRaBkVe0) 
while i did some changes into it such as keeping the randomly assigned letters same so if someone want to decrypt an old sentence that could be possible,
while also giving choice to user to exit or keep encrypting or decrypting some new texts
there not much new in this code the basic concept is same to the youtube tutorial i learned from 
thank you for reading.
